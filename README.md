This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

## About the project: 

 Given a credit card number, this function should return a string with the </br>
 name of a network, like 'MasterCard' or 'American Express'</br>
 </br>
 Example: detectNetwork('343456789012345') should return 'American Express'
